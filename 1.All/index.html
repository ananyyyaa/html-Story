    <p><b>We all have read many story books in our life time , but there is an amazing wonder the nature tells us stories , did'nt understand what i said right .

    <p><b>When you observe the sky the shape of clouds sometimes seems like a bird , sometimes an animal , a devil , a ship , a flower , and what not , moving around you it seems like the nature is trying to tell us a story through the clouds . May be a historical or something magical or a war. </b></p>
